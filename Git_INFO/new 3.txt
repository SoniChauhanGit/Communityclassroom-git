"you cannot remove a commit in between becoz each commit is build on top of other". 
which ever commit you want to remove copy the hash number of the commit below e.g x.
use command git reset x
this will bring back the project to the x version and all the above changes will be unstaged.

 git stash (to backup all the changes that are staged)
 git stash pop (to bring back all the changes from backup)
 git stash clear ( to remove backup data)
